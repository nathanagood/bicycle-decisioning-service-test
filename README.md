# Example decisioning service created by IBM Automation Decision Services (ADS)

The service in this repository was created by following the 
"[Getting Started](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-biz-automation/23.0.1?topic=resources-getting-started)" 
documentation and doing "[Task 2: Connecting to a Git repository and sharing a decision service](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-biz-automation/23.0.1?topic=gs-task-2-connecting-git-repository-sharing-decision-service)".

See the https://github.com/nathanagood/bicycle-decisioning-microservice 
repository to see an example of using the [execution Java API](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-biz-automation/23.0.1?topic=services-executing-decision-execution-java-api) in a [Open Liberty](https://openliberty.io/)-based 
microservice that can also be deployed as a container in 
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) or [Red Hat OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift).
